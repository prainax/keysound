# Keysound
Play a sound every time a key is pressed on your system. This application utilizes Python's Xlib library for monitoring key events and offers a customizable experience where users can specify their preferred sound files.

If you want to make some kind of screencast that features keyboard typing sounds, this might come in handy. Get the script, run keypress.py and pump up your volume.
