# Keysound
If you want to make some kind of screencast that features keyboard typing sounds, this might come in handy. Get the script, run keypress.py and pump up your volume.

Requirements
Python

python-xlib (On Debian-based, install with sudo apt-get install python-xlib)

aplay command line player, but you really can dump in anything you want, see keypress.py

Rip-off!!!
Yes, this was adopted from Sayan “Riju” Chakrabarti (sayanriju).

Why didn’t you just fork it?¶ ↑
Good question, guess it just didn’t occur to me :)

What’s changed?
The first time I looked at the code, I couldn’t really figure out what was going on. There was a senatra web server acting as a proxy that all the keypresses would go through which I didn’t understand. Not to say that wasn’t the correct approach, but it wasn’t the approach I needed/wanted. I did some looking on threading and tried my best at getting each call to aplay working so that there wasn’t a delay.

Can it play different sounds for different keys?¶ ↑
The original one that sayanriju made could, and this one will eventually.
